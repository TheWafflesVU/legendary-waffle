Project Description:

Our project is an online platform where student engineers can post their project ideas, complete their profile with skill sets and other information, and match with other student engineers in need to create, collaborate and work on existing or new projects. This could also be a platform for discussing project ideas with teammates using the online chat feature and socializing with student engineers on campus. We will first introduce our product to Vanderbilt students and make improvements accordingly, then we can apply it to a bigger scope such as companies.

Framework:

We will use the MERN stack for this project. M stands for MongoDB document base; E stands for Express, which is a Node.js web framework; R means React and it is a client-side JavaScript framework; N stands for Node.js and it is the JavaScript web server.
